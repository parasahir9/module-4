OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data,
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.


OOP provides a clear structure for the programs. OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain,
modify and debug. OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.
